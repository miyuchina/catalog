        What is this?
      </p>
      <p class="a">
        This is an unofficial version of the Williams College Catalog!
        It comes with all the benefits of running a rogue website
        without any college support:
        be warned that the information might be out-of-date,
        and that it is highly probable
        I might decide to nuke my own server.
        Seriously. I'm saying this because I've done this.
      </p>

      <p class="q">
        ... but why?
      </p>
      <p class="a">
        Partly because the current one is slow
        and not very friendly to mobile usage.
        And browsing through or searching for courses is terrible.
        But mostly for fun.
      </p>

      <p class="q">
        ... but how?
      </p>
      <p class="a">
        This is a one-person project hacked together in a week.
        The whole thing is currently running on a DigitalOcean VPS in New York,
        which costs $5 per month.
        I wrote the scraper (sorry OIT) in Python,
        REST API in Flask,
        and the frontend in Elm.
        <a href="https://github.com/miyuchina/catalog">Here's the code</a>
        if you want to stare at it.
      </p>

      <p class="q">
        What are buckets?
      </p>
      <p class="a">
        You can put courses in your bucket
        by clicking on the bookmark symbol next to each course!
        Click on "View Bucket" to see what's in your bucket.
        Your bucket is saved locally in your browser,
        so as long as you don't clear your browsing history
        it should survive any number of reloading the page.
      </p>
      <p class="a">
        If I get to it
        I might add the functionality to check for schedule conflicts
        in your bucket.
        Once I've implemented user accounts
        you will also be able to create multiple buckets
        and save them on the server.
        So that you can have your buckets forever.
        Until I nuke 'em.
      </p>

      <p class="q">
        What can I search for?
      </p>
      <p class="a">
        Currently only the department code, course number,
        title and instructors.
        I might add division requirements in the future.
      </p>

      <p class="q">
        Can you add X? / X is not working!
      </p>
      <p class="a">
        Shoot me an email (unix: my4) and I'll see what I can do!
